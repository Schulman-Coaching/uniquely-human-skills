        <h1>Revised Program Outlines for Uniquely Human Skills</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">AI Adaptation Cohorts: Program Tracks Outline<br>For Intact Teams & Individual Leaders</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
        <p>The AI Adaptation Cohort is a transformative, 52-week journey designed for professionals navigating the profound shifts brought by artificial intelligence. This is not a traditional course with a rigid syllabus. It is a guided collaborative experience where the curriculum is co-created by the cohort's real-world challenges and opportunities. Our facilitator's role is to provide structure, tools, and frameworks, but the primary learning emerges from the shared wisdom and support of the group.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Core Philosophy:</strong><br>
            Our approach is built on three pillars:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Cohort is the Catalyst:</strong> Change and insight are driven by peer interaction, not top-down instruction.</li>
                <li><strong>The Curious Desirability of Problems:</strong> We reframe challenges as the essential fuel for innovation and growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpersonal Relationship Learning (IRL):</strong> Skills are built and practiced <em>within</em> the dynamic, supportive relationships of the cohort.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Program Details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 52 weeks</li>
            <li><strong>Session Frequency:</strong> Weekly, 90-minute virtual meetings</li>
            <li><strong>Investment:</strong> $50 per member per session ($2,600 annually), billed monthly</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Choose Your Path: Two Transformative Options</h2>

        <h3>Track 1: Intact Team Cohort</h3>
        <p><strong>For teams that want to transform together.</strong></p>
        <p>Ideal for departments, leadership teams, or project groups within the same company who need to navigate AI adaptation as a unified force.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who It's For:</strong> Existing teams from a single organization (e.g., a leadership team, a product department, a cross-functional unit).</li>
            <li><strong>The Benefit:</strong> Tackle your <em>specific</em> organizational challenges in a confidential setting. Build shared language, frameworks, and trust that you can immediately apply to your work, dramatically improving internal collaboration and strategic alignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A more cohesive, adaptive, and resilient team ready to face disruption as one.</li>
            <li><strong>Cohort Size:</strong> 6-8 members from the same organization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Track 2: Individual & Community Cohort</h3>
        <p><strong>For leaders and innovators seeking a like-minded community.</strong></p>
        <p>Join a curated group of peers from non-competing organizations to gain external perspectives, break out of your echo chamber, and build a powerful professional network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who It's For:</strong> Individuals, solopreneurs, and leaders from non-competing organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Curated by Industry & Identity:</strong> To ensure maximum relevance and psychological safety, we offer cohorts curated by professional industry (e.g., Tech, Healthcare, Non-Profit, Education) and <strong>gender-specific cohorts</strong> (Women's Cohorts, Men's Cohorts) for those who value a dedicated space for discussion.</li>
            <li><strong>The Benefit:</strong> Gain unbiased insights from diverse perspectives you can't find within your own company. Form lifelong connections and become part of a trusted council that provides support and accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A renewed sense of purpose, a valuable external support network, and strategies you can bring back to energize your own organization.</li>
            <li><strong>Cohort Size:</strong> 6-8 members from non-competing organizations</li>
        </ul>
